- **Physics-Based Motion:** Uses [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) to simulate gravity, collisions, and friction for skill badges.
- **Draggable Objects:** Users can drag skills around with mouse or touch.
- **Scroll Triggered:** Animation starts when the section enters the viewport using [GSAP ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/).
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Powered by [Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis) for buttery smooth scroll behavior.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop; hidden on mobile for better usability.
